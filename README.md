docker-compose with multiple [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) services:
* youtrack (issue tracker)
* teamcity (ci)
* upsource (code browser)
* hub (centralized auth)

STILL IN PROGRESS

TODO:
* configure nginx as proxy

NICE TO HAVE
* use lightweight docker base image (FROM)
* push images to docker-hub
